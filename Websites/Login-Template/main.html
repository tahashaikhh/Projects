      <h3>Slowly</h3>
      <p>If the need goes slow one step at a time but don’ stop trying. Accept the challenges and move on.

This helps in proper analysis and introspection of the actions and outcomes. You are able to identify the underlying and hidden factors which are hindering your progress. One can work over them, plan out new strategies to work more efficiently.</p>

      <h3>Do it</h3>
      <p>Do you have a dream that you’ve buried deep down inside because you think it’s just not possible to attain? Maybe life has gotten in the way and you believe “Oh well, it’s just not meant to be.” You might think that and yet the dream stays there inside of you, lingering and resurfacing once in a while. There is a reason that dream is there. It’s like a seed that was planted and just needs to be watered to come to life and grow. And that seed is meant to be brought into this world by YOU via action, not just by thinking about it.You’ve got to go out there . Stop doing what is easy. Start doing what is right.</p>

      <h3>Time</h3>
      <p>The process of aging is a complex one that can be described chronologically, physiologically, and functionally. Chronological age refers to the number of years a person has lived. Physiological age refers to the determination of age by body function. Functional age refers to a person’s ability to contribute to society and benefit others and himself.We should the value and respect the importance of time every single moment. We should not waste time at all till the end moment of our life. Time is very strong and powerful than everything in this world. It can give lots of happiness, joy and prosperity. </p>

      <h3>Work</h3>
      <p>There are different kinds of work that people do to sustain their livelihood. Some people are doctors, and some are lawyers, some are cooks, some are the ones who help us to keep the city clean. All type of work is respectable. Therefore the one doing the work should have respect for the work they do. However, nowadays, people only work to earn money. They have no love for the work they do. We worship God to receive his blessings. Therefore we should also work to get God’s blessing and not to get something materialistic. The whole idea of working should be to please the deity and ourselves.</p>

  <h3>Vision</h3>
  <p>we’ve the passion, the energy and enthusiasm to achieve something we desire. But, what if we don’t know what we want from the life? We’ll be lost and aimless. This is certainly not an ideal situation. If you’re running a big organization, you must have a vision set for the growth and progress of your business. Visions helps in business strategy formulation.</p>
