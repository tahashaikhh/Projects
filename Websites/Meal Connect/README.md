#Meal Connect

Meal Connect is a web application that aims to reduce food wastage and hunger by connecting food donors and non-profit organizations.

About
This project was built during the Algorithm hackathon at Anjuman-I-Islam's Kalsekar Technical Campus in June 2022 by a team of 4 developers. It aligns with the UN's Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger.

Meal Connect enables hotels, restaurants and other food businesses to list their excess usable food inventory. Non-profit organizations can claim this food and redistribute to people in need.
